          ChessViewer is built with open source, and it tries to support open
          source in return. None of it would exist without the projects, tools,
          and communities below — thank you to everyone who builds and maintains
          them.

          Finally, thank you to everyone who reports bugs, suggests
          improvements, contributes code, and simply uses ChessViewer. The
          project is better because of the community around it.
