          Simply put, ChessViewer is a free tool that lets you build chess
          positions and turn them into high-quality images for print or screen.
          Drag the pieces onto the board however you want, pick a style, and
          download. Nothing to install, no sign-up — it all runs right in your
          browser, fast.

      <InfoCard title="Why does this exist?">
        <p>
          Say you need a clean chess board image for a book, an article, a
          YouTube video, or a worksheet for your students. That&apos;s exactly
          what ChessViewer is for. It is not an engine — it will not suggest
          moves or play against you. It has one job: turn the position you build
          into the sharpest, cleanest image possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it is completely free — no annoying ads, no code tracking you in
          the background, no &quot;upgrade to Premium&quot; popups.

          <li>
            <strong className="text-text-primary">Simple controls.</strong> Just
            grab a piece and drop it where you want on the board. Flip the
            board, hide or show coordinates — it all works the way you&apos;d
            expect.

      <InfoCard title="Do I have to sign up?">
        <p>
          Not at all. Open the site and start working — everything stays in your
          browser. If you do create an account, you get one extra perk: your
          positions and settings sync across your devices, phone and computer
          alike. Your data is protected by row-level security in the database —
          only your account can read your rows, nobody else&apos;s. You can also
          turn on two-factor authentication for extra peace of mind.

      <InfoCard title="The idea behind it">
        <p>
          ChessViewer started as something built just for one person — a fast
          way to put together a decent chess diagram without wrestling with
          image editors or paying for software that does too much. Turns out
          other people needed the same thing, so it was made open source and put
          out there for everyone.

        <p>
          There is no company or investor behind it. Your data isn&apos;t sold
          to anyone, nothing tracks you in the background, and nothing here is
          paid. The code is all on GitHub — read it, run it locally, or send in
          a contribution whenever you want.
