## What it does

- **Board editor** — drag pieces onto any square, flip the board, toggle coordinates and border frame
- **FEN input** — paste any FEN string with real-time validation; batch input supports up to 10 positions at once
- **Export** — PNG, JPEG, or SVG at four quality presets (300–1200 DPI); batch export downloads a ZIP; DPI metadata is embedded in the file
- **Board customisation** — 20 piece sets, 20 preset themes, custom colour picker, up to 48 saved presets
- **Position history** — saved locally with favourites, pinning, freshness indicators, and full-text search
- **Database search** — look up positions directly from Lichess and ChessDB
- **Optional account** — sign in to sync your history and settings across devices via Supabase; data is encrypted at rest and owner-scoped by row-level security

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide. The short version:

```bash
git checkout -b fix/your-fix
pnpm validate
git commit -m "fix: brief description"
git push origin fix/your-fix
# open a pull request against master
```

Every PR must reference an open issue (`Closes #N`) and pass CI before it can be merged.

## Security and privacy

Board rendering and export run entirely client-side — positions never leave your device. There are no analytics or tracking cookies.

Optional cloud sync stores data in Supabase with row-level security: only the authenticated user can read or write their own rows.

To report a vulnerability, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
